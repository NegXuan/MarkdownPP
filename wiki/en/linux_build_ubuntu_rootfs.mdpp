Modify your root file system can exit:

```
exit
```

## Make the root file system

Make your own root file system, depending on the size of your root file system, and note that the count value is modified based on the size of the temp folder:

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=linuxroot.img bs=1M count=2048
sudo  mkfs.ext4 linuxroot.img
mkdir  rootfs
sudo mount linuxroot.img rootfs/
sudo cp -rfp temp/*  rootfs/
sudo umount rootfs/
e2fsck -p -f linuxroot.img
resize2fs  -M linuxroot.img
```

`linuxroot.img` is the final root file system image file.

### FAQs

#### Q : After the root file system is loaded, the size is not normal and does not occupy the entire partition?

A : Execute the extended file system command after the system is loaded correctly:

```
resize2fs /dev/mtd/by-name/linuxroot
```
